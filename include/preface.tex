\chapter{Preface}

This is an introductory textbook on modal logic. I use it as the main
text when I teach Philosophy~579.2 (Modal Logic) at the University of
Calgary. It is based on material from the
\href{https://openlogicproject.org}{Open Logic Project}.

The main text assumes familiarity with some elementary set theory and
the basics of (propositional) logic. This material is part of a
prerequisite for my course, Logic~II. The textbook for that course,
\href{https://slc.openlogicproject.org}{\emph{Sets, Logic,
Computation}}, is also based on the OLP, and so is available for free.
The required material is included as appendices in this book,
however. I assign these appendices for background reading whenever I
teach the material.

\Cref{nml:::part} is originally based in part on Aldo Antonelli's
lecture notes on ``Classical Correspondence Theory for Basic Modal
Logic,'' which he contributed to the OLP before his untimely death in
2015. I heavily revised and expanded these notes, e.g., the material
on frame definability and tableaux is new.
